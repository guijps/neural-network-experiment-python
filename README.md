# neural-network-experiment-python
Using Python and PyTorch to create a Neural Network (NN) capable of recognizing handwritten numbers.

## Introduction
I'm very interested in how things are made. This time, I will dive into Neural Networks. My main objective is to understand in detail how NNs work and how they are used nowadays. My final plan is to implement a handwritten number recognition program using Neural Networks from scratch in C++. However, to achieve this, I first need to understand how Neural Networks work on a broader scale, then delve into the details of lower-level programming. Thus, I will use PyTorch to create a handwritten number recognition program, understand the steps and their details (what processes are involved, what values are involved, and where they come from), until I have a solid foundation to start development in C++.

## Objective
Develop a Python program using PyTorch (neural networks) to recognize handwritten numbers from 0 to 9 using the MNIST database. Understand key concepts, and learn the main processes involved in acquiring the data, training the model, and using it for our cases.
